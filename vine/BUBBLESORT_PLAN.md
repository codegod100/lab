# Action Plan for Completing Vine Bubblesort with Inverse Paradigm

## Current Status
We've been working on implementing a bubblesort algorithm in Vine that utilizes the inverse paradigm to replace traditional loops. The code currently has some variable scope issues that need to be fixed.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix the `check_sorted` function**:
   - Address the variable scope issues with `prev`
   - Use proper pattern matching with the iterator
   - Ensure the inverse variable correctly tracks sort status

2. **Fix the `sort_list` function**:
   - Ensure correct handling of element swaps
   - Fix comparison between elements
   - Properly use references or other correct mechanism to update list elements

3. **Update the main `bubblesort` function**:
   - Ensure proper use of the inverse paradigm for communication
   - Correctly handle the messaging based on sort status

4. **Test the implementation**:
   - With various inputs including:
     - Already sorted lists
     - Reverse sorted lists
     - Random lists
     - Edge cases (empty, single element)

5. **Optimize further**:
   - Look for opportunities to further leverage the inverse paradigm
   - Consider using the "time travel" pattern shown in the documentation

## Key Concepts to Apply

1. **Inverse variables**: Use `~var` syntax correctly for bidirectional flow
2. **References**: Use `&var` correctly for modifying elements in place
3. **Do blocks**: Use the `do` construct for inverse pattern scope
4. **Iterator pattern**: Consider using iterators instead of direct indexing
5. **Pattern matching**: Use `is` expressions for cleaner code

## Resources to Reference

- `/workspaces/lab/vine/docs/src/features/inverse.md` for inverse pattern guidance
- `/workspaces/lab/vine/vine/examples/sub_min.vi` for a working example of inverse
- The pattern from the documentation for "time travel" to potentially eliminate one pass

## Implementation Ideas

### Potential "Time Travel" Optimization
Similar to the `sub_min` example, we could potentially use inverse variables to eliminate a pass through the list:

```rust
fn optimized_sort(&list: &List[N32]) -> N32 {
  // Use an inverse variable to store the final state
  let ~is_sorted: Bool;
  let ~pass_count: N32;
  
  // Track the state as we go
  let pass = 0;
  
  // Do passes until sorted
  while pass < list.len() - 1 {
    let any_swap = false;
    
    // Single pass through elements
    // ... (bubble sort logic)
    
    // If no swaps made, we're done
    if !any_swap {
      ~is_sorted = true;
      ~pass_count = pass + 1;
      break;
    }
    
    pass += 1;
  }
  
  // Set final values
  if !is_sorted {
    ~pass_count = list.len() - 1;
  }
  
  pass_count
}
```

The key insight is to use inverse variables to propagate information "backwards" in time, which can simplify logic and eliminate redundant operations.
